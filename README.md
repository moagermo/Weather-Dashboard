# Weather-Dashboard
Weather web app that you can check local cities' weather to plan accordingly

# Description
It's always a good idea to check the weather before you travel anywhere, or make plans to do anything outside. Personally, I have experienced that unexpected rain drop whilst having had planned to spray paint -- oops. This app will help you figure out the weather wherever you want to check.
